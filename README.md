# vaccine-scheduler
Project Description: This is a vaccine scheduling application (with a database hosted on Microsoft Azure) that can be deployed by hospitals or clinics and supports interaction with users through the terminal/command-line interface. This is also an appointment scheduler for vaccinations, where the users are patients and caregivers and it keeps track of vaccine stock and appointments. Patients can book and cancel vaccination appointments and caregivers can upload and remove availabilities. Patients and caregivers can both create accounts and check vaccine stock.
